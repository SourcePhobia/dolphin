# Dolphin â€” Server-Side Execution Tool

Dolphin is a server-side remote execution environment designed for educational purposes in Roblox games. It offers controlled access to powerful runtime tools, player management features, and server introspection capabilities through a persistent remote. This was built as a fun project to increase my skills in security. Server source code will not be released due to the chance of it being used for malicious purposes.
